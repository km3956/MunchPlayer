# MunchPlayer

I developed an AI agent to play a 2-player adversarial game where players fill rectangles on a grid, aiming to avoid filling the final square. I implemented a RandomPlayer that makes moves randomly and a MinimaxPlayer using the minimax algorithm for strategic play. The minimax agent includes an evaluation function to assess game states and make optimal decisions, outperforming the random agent by consistently winning. This project involved coding game logic, implementing search algorithms, and comparing AI strategies to enhance gameplay performance.
